## Overview
This repository contains a Node.js app. The project focuses on building a CI workflow using GitHub Actions to automate testing of a pre-existing Node.js application ("Student Registry").

## Project Goals:

- Implement a CI workflow in GitHub Actions.
- Configure the workflow to run tests on the "Student Registry" application.
- Test the application using multiple Node.js versions.

## Prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of Node.js and testing frameworks.
- Familiarity with GitHub Actions.
  
## Setup:

- Clone this repository.
- Install dependencies and run the application:
  
  ``` sh
  npm install
  npm start
  ```
  
- Review the existing "Student Registry" application code.
  
## Running Tests:

The CI workflow is already defined in the `.github/workflows` directory. Pushing your code to the main branch will trigger the workflow automatically. The workflow will:

- Set up the environment.
- Install dependencies.
- Run tests for the "Student Registry" application on two different Node.js versions.
## Additional Notes:

- This project serves as a demonstration of CI/CD concepts using a pre-existing application.
- The specific details of the "Student Registry" application are not covered in this repository.
